# Trust Bar

The TrustBar is a a component that takes an array of companies and renders their logos into a bar with an option of two
different inherent effects.

### Shutter

The bar shows 5 different logos at a time contained at 1170px that "shutter" up and get replaced infinitly.

This view is only available in tablet viewports and above and required a minimum of 5 logos. When in mobile, it will
default to the `scrolling` view.

### Scrolling

The bar scrolls at full screen width from right to left showing all listed company logos. The bar will pause when
hovered over.
