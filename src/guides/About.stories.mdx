# Welcome to the Deepgram UI Library!

The Deepgram UI Library is based on the Deepgram UI Library template repository built to quickly jump start new
React-based website projects.

<br />

## To start development

Install all necessary dependencies. This project uses `yarn` as its package manager.

```shell
# run these commands in your cli
yarn
yarn start
```

The Storybook contains a set of useful guide docs, design system definitions, live demos, and documentation for all
components included in the Deepgram UI Library.

To run Storybook locally, simply run:

```shell
yarn storybook
```

## Features

The Deepgram UI Library offers several features that make it easier to build new websites with. Full guides on them
exist in the Storybook.

1. **Foundations**: These are a code implementation of a design system. Values can be replaced easily and used across
   the project via quarks.
2. **Components**: These are React components mostly built using [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) that give you a
   head-start in building out your new site.
