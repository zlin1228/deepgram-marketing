# Typography

The Typography atom provides pre-defined values for `fontWeight`, `fontSize`, `fontFamily`, `lineHeight`, and
`letterSpacing` props for use on quarks, molecules, and components.

## Usage

<br />

### FontSize and LineHeight

Values like `fontSize` and `lineHeight` take number values corresponding with a size in pixels.

```tsx
<Paragraph fontSize="textMd" lineHeight="lg">
  Changing font size and line height!
</Paragraph>
```

However, the element is ultimately rendered using rem values. So this Paragraph will have `font-size: 1rem;` and
`line-height: 1.5rem;`.

### FontWeight

`fontWeight` takes a string that corresponds with a numbered weight value.

```tsx
<Paragraph fontWeight="semiBold">Changing the font weight!</Paragraph>
```

For example, `semiBold` will become `font-weight: 600;`.

### LetterSpacing

Likewise, `letterSpacing` takes a string that corresponds with a pre-defined size value from the atom.

```tsx
<Paragraph letterSpacing="neg2">Changing the letter spacing!</Paragraph>
```

`neg2` will become `letter-spacing: -0.02em;`.

### FontFamily

Fonts should be set in the global theme, which can be found in `quarks/GlobalStyles.tsx`, rather than added to each
element manually.

However, if you need to set font at the element level, you can do so by passing in a string referring to a key from the
typography atom:

```tsx
<Paragraph fontFamily="primaryFont">Font Family!</Paragraph>
```

By default there is only a single primary font - additional ones must be added to the atom.

### TextStyle Prop

The `textStyle` prop will set `fontFamily`, `fontSize`, and `lineHeight` with values best suited for the size chosen. It
accepts a string corresponding with a size value:

```tsx
<Paragraph textStyle="md">Changing the text style!</Paragraph>
```

This will render the paragraph with the shorthand `font` property:
`font: 1rem/1.5rem "Averta","Helvetica Neue","Arial Nova",sans-serif;`

## Customization

To customize the typography atom to match your design system, you can edit the values stored in
`src/atoms/typography/typography.ts`.

All available typography values are viewable in the Canvas tab and you can experiment with them in the
[Container quark story](?path=/story/quarks-container--container).
