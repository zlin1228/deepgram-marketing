# Spacing

The Spacing atom provides pre-defined values assignable to `margin` and `padding` props for use on quarks, molecules,
and components.

## Usage

The spacing atom uses number keys representing a pixel value, which can be passed directly into quarks:

```tsx
<Container marginAll={16} paddingLeft={32}>
  I am a container!
</Container>
```

However, the component is ultimately rendered using rem values equivalents of the corresponding pixel number. For
example, the above Container will have `padding-left: 2rem;` and `margin: 1rem;`.

## Customization

If you wish to customize the Spacing atom to fit your design system, you can do so by changing the values in
`src/atoms/spacing/spacing.ts`.

All available values can be found in Canvas tab and you can experiment with them in the
[Container quark story](?path=/story/quarks-container--container).

<Story name="Spacing" story={spacing} />
