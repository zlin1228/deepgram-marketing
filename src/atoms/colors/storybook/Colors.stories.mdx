# Colors

The pre-defined color values found in the Color atom provide consistency across a project and are assignable to the
`backgroundColor`, `textColor` and `borderColor` props on all quarks, molecules, and components.

## Usage

The color atom consists of a nested object containing numbered sets of colors. For example, "gray" contains a set of
colors with numbers 25-900. These colors can be referenced by entering a string value with the category followed by the
number separated by a hyphen.

```tsx
<Container backgroundColor="gray-800" textColor="gray-25">
  Light gray text on dark gray background
</Container>
```

### Light and Dark Mode

To specify separate colors for light mode and dark mode, you can pass two separate colors assigned to `light` and `dark`
in an object.

```tsx
<Container backgroundColor={{ light: 'common-black', dark: 'common-white' }}>
  This container is light and dark mode ready!
</Container>
```

## Customization

If you wish to customize the Color atom to best fit your project, you can do so by changing the values in
`src/atoms/colors/colors.ts`.

**Important:** Changing the hex values is safe but changing the key values will affect all existing references to that
color entry. However, changing color names can and should still be done as long as all existing references across the
repository are also updated. No values are hard-coded, so a simple find and replace using your IDE should be sufficient
to change all instance of each color.

All available color values are viewable in the Canvas tab and you can experiment with them in the
[Container quark story](?path=/story/quarks-container--container).
