# Icons

This UI Library uses React Icons, which offers 21 different libraries with a total of more than 23k different icons. A
[complete searchable list](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) of all icons can be found with React Icons docs.
If an icon is not available within one of these libraries, webpack can be configured to import SVGs as ReactComponents
as explained in the [Gatsby](?path=/docs/guides-set-up-gatsby--page#add-support-for-svgs-as-react-components) and
[NextJS](?path=/docs/guides-set-up-nextjs--page) docs.

## Usage

Icons are imported from React Icons along with a two letter abbreviation for its particular library. For example, `fi`
refers to Feather Icons.

```tsx
import { FiCoffee } from 'react-icons/fi';

<Container>
  <FiCoffee />
</Container>;
```

You can also pass these icons into any prop which accepts a `ReactNode`:

```tsx
import { FiCoffee } from 'react-icons/fi';

const CoffeeButton = () => <Button endIcon={<FiCoffee />}>Click here for coffee!</Button>;
```

### Color

Each icon will inherit the `textColor` of its parent element and doing so is recommended in order to take advantage of
theme colors from quarks. However, the icon can take a color prop that accepts any valid CSS color arguments.

## Props

The props allow you to customize the icon you're displaying, including its `color`, `fill`, `width`, `height`, `stroke`,
`title`, and [many more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute).

```tsx
import { FiCoffee } from 'react-icons/fi';

<Container textColor="primary-800">
  <FiCoffee stroke="#FFF" width={40} strokeWidth={2} title="Coffee Icon" />
</Container>;
```

<Story name="Icons" story={Icons} />

<ArgsTable story="Icons" />
