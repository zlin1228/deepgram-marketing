# Dropdown

Input selects are used to group together actions in a subview. They're useful for allowing users to select from a large
amount of options, or to even search for options within the input field before selecting.

## Usage

`Select` can be used in any instance where you want the user to select an item from a select menu.

### list

The `list` prop accepts a ReactNode array, including a simple array of strings or a mapped array of React Components to
allow for multiple elements and styling

### label & selectName

The `label` and `selectName` props are both optional and inherently light/dark mode optimized.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Dropdown" story={stories.dropdown} />
</Canvas>

### Props

<ArgsTable story="Dropdown" />
