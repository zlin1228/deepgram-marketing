# Switch

Switches toggle the state of a single setting on or off. Switches are the preferred way to adjust settings on mobile.
The option that the switch controls, as well as the state it's in, should be made clear from the corresponding inline
label.

## Usage

#### Controlled component

You can control the switch with the `checked` and `onChange` props:

#### Labels

You can provide a label to the `Switch` via the `label` prop and helper text via the `helperText` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Switch" story={stories.Switch} />
</Canvas>

### Props

<ArgsTable story="Switch" />
