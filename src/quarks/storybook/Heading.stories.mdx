# Heading

Heading is a used to create `<h>` tags, with a default of `<h1>`.

Heading accepts all basic props found in the [Container](?path=/docs/quarks-container--container) quark story, as well
as the `textStyle` prop.

### `As` Prop

The type of heading can be changed via the `as` prop, which also changes the size of the heading automatically according
to the display values set in the typography atom tag.

### `TextStyle` Prop

If you want a heading of a certain type, but want to use it with a different size, you can use the `textStyle` prop,
which overwrites the styling set from the `as` prop and allows you to define the heading size using values from the
[typography](?path=/story/atoms-typography--typography) atom.

### Manual Overrides

If you instead want to mix and match font properties (ex. font size and line height that don't normally go together) you
can still set those properties using the basic props.

#### Warning

Styles will override each other based on the order in which they are set in the component. Props are processed from
beginning to end, so props set earlier on will get overridden by ones set further down. For this reason, it is advised
to set the `as` prop first, followed by `textStyle`, followed by any manual overrides last.

```tsx
<Heading as="h6" textStyle="xl" fontWeight="semiBold" fontSize="textLg" lineHeight="lg" textColor="primary-600">
  {heading}
</Heading>
```

In the above example, the heading will render as an `<h6>`, but `textStyle` will override the default `h6` style, and
finally `fontSize` and `lineHeight` will override those properties from `textStyle`.
