# Text

Text is a `<span>` tag.

Text accepts all basic props found in the [Container](?path=/docs/quarks-container--container) quark story, as well as
the `textStyle` prop.

### `TextStyle` Prop

The `textStyle` prop is used to set the Text's size using values from the
[typography](?path=/story/atoms-typography--typography) atom.

### Manual Overrides

If you instead want to mix and match font properties (ex. font size and line height that don't normally go together) you
can still set those properties using the basic props.

#### Warning

Styles will override each other based on the order in which they are set in the component. Props are processed from
beginning to end, so props set earlier on will get overridden by ones set further down. For this reason, it is advised
to set the `textStyle` first followed by any manual overrides.

```tsx
<Text textStyle="xl" fontWeight="semiBold" fontSize="textLg" lineHeight="lg" textColor="primary-600">
  {text}
</Text>
```

In the above example, the text will use the style set as "xl" in the `text` type of
[typography](?path=/story/atoms-typography--typography), then `fontSize` and `lineHeight` will override those
properties.

  <Story name="Text" story={text} />
